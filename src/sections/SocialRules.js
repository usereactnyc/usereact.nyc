      We would also like to borrow the Social Rules from the{' '}

      <li>No well-actuallyâ€™s</li>
      <li>No feigned surprise</li>
      <li>No backseat driving</li>
      <li>No subtle -isms</li>
    </ul>

      For full a full description of each social rule, please see RC's{' '}

    <p>
      Like RC, these rules are not a hard contract. They are designed to
      encourage a fun, welcoming, meetup where everyone can enjoy themselves.

    <p>
      If you find yourself or someone else breaking a social rule, acknowledge
      the situation and move on.
