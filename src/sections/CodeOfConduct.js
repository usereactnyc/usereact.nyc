    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>
      useReactNYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience
      for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any
      form. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
      expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the meetup organizers. If
      this is a paid event they may be expelled without a refund at the
      discretion of the meetup organizers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
      identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
      deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
      recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
      physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to
      stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Exhibitors and speakers at any useReactNYC event also subject to the
      anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors/speakers should not use
      sexualized images, activities, or other material. Staff (including
      volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
      otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may
      take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
      expulsion from the event with no refund (if applicable). In the event of
      serious infractions of the code of conduct, useReactNYC staff may share
      incident details and offenders’ names with third parties including but not
      limited to: venue staff, local law enforcement, and staff of other
      meetups/conferences. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else
      is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
      meetup staff immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      useReactNYC has an additional rule of no videotaping or photography
      without prior permission. If you wish to photograph, film or record any
      attendee, including speakers, you must first ask for their permission to
      do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meetup staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or
      local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
      experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of events. We value
      your attendance.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and
      conference-related social events.
